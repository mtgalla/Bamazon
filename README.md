# Bamazon
 The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

## Initial Setup
Running the `bamazonCustomer.js` application will display all the various products available on the Bamazon store.
The products will display the following:
- Product ID number
- Department
- Price
- Remaining quantity in stock.

Note that the Product ID will be needed to place an order.

## Place an Order
After the products are displayed, you will be asked to enter the Product ID of the product you would like to Purcahse along with the quantity.

## Order Placed
Once an order has successfully been placed, the total price will be displayed.
At this time the stock inventory for that product will be updated to reflect the new quantity remaining.
